# smart-autograder

## abstract
Measuring student achievement through evaluation is vital in the learning process. These measurements will determine the student's ability to absorb information during the learning process Teachers often set subjective/descriptive questions to measure students' comprehensive ability and thought process and higher order thinking levels. This causes the need for an intelligent auto-grading system to ease the examiner's load. This also reduces the time consumed for grading answer sheets manually. Hence, comparing answer sheets with their keys and grading them is a task that should be automated. For this purpose, we would like to implement an automatic grading system based on Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning Technologies, Semantic similarity matching, and Statistical methods, which can focus on the critical words and sentences, analyze the context relationship and predict the grades.
